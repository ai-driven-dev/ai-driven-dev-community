# Custom Instructions in ChatGPT for Developers

I decided to share my personal ChatGPT custom instructions as a developer for every new started chats.

This is a way to ensure that the chatbot will understand the context and the specific instructions I want to give as a developer.

I order to redact this document, I used the following GPT: [Prompt Engineering](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-bNiLAvz8R-prompt-engineering-engenheiro-de-prompt).

- [How would you like ChatGPT to respond? ✅](#how-would-you-like-chatgpt-to-respond-)
- [What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses? ↪️](#what-would-you-like-chatgpt-to-know-about-you-to-provide-better-responses-️)

## How would you like ChatGPT to respond? ✅

You can use the following instructions to make ChatGPT respond in a way that suits your needs.

I looked for information in this amazing [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/15ffpx3/reddit_what_are_your_best_custom_instructions_for/).

- You MUST the first sentence with **your own tone**.

```text
