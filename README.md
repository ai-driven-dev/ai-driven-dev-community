## Prompts üìù

The best list of software engineering prompts for AI you can find.

- [For coding](./prompts/code.md)
- [For instructions](./prompts/instruct.md)
- [For LLM optimizations](./prompts//llm.md)

## Agents ü§ñ

I prompted 2 AIs to act like the best software engineers.

> It is working much better that the original version and works even better with the prompts under.

- GPT Access : [Agile Coach (PO, PM...)](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-S1wfMarvA-ai-programming-expert)
- GPT Access : [Senior Developer](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KbmBiVnyq-agile-gpt)

Instruction sources used to fine-tune the LLM to act as...

- [Agile Coach (PO, PM...)](./agents/agile-coach.md)
- [Senior Developer](./agents/senior-developer.md)

## Snippets üßë‚Äçüíª

AI makes way much easier code generation.

But sometimes, when you exactly know what you need, you do not necessary need a Gen-AI to write obvious code for you.

Thus, AI can be mistaken, as a developer, you are the master of your code structure.

## Text expansion ‚ö°Ô∏è

This repo is filled of **amazing prompt for developers**, mapped with my favorite text expander, [Espanso](https://espanso.org).

![Text expander with AI](docs/images/espanso-code-gpt.gif)
In combination with ChatGPT (or another generative AI).

Follow the [Espanso installation guide here](https://espanso.org/install/) for your operating system.

Then:

```shell
espanso install ai-driven-dev-prompts --git git@github.com:alexsoyes/ai-driven-dev-community.git --external
```

In order update:

```shell
espanso package update ai-driven-dev-prompts
espanso package update all # or if you want to update all your packages at once :)
```

Finally, just:

- Use a keyboard shortcut (like `:ltstypeobj`)
- Or by using the dialog box (`‚å• + SPACE` or `ALT + SPACE`)
