# A tailored list of developer prompts üìã

Every good software engineer needs good prompts!

This repo is filled of **amazing prompt for developers**, mapped with my favorite text expander, [Espanso](https://espanso.org).

üëâ *You are not forced to use a text expander tool but this is highly recommended!*

‚ôªÔ∏è This is a WIP one, do not hesitate to contribute kicking errors and improving prompts!

üöÄ Contribution are welcomed, [check the guide](./contributing.md)

## A french community

Join a group of french software engineers that are using AI.

## Do not use ChatGPT standalone

I prompted two AI to act like the best software engineers.

* [AI programming expert](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-S1wfMarvA-ai-programming-expert) - [(source)](./agents/mentor-developer.md)
* [AI project manager](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KbmBiVnyq-agile-gpt) - [(source)](./agents/agile.md)

> It is working much better that the original version and works even better with the prompts under.

## Text expansion

### Installation

Follow the [Espanso installation guide here](https://espanso.org/install/) for your operating system.

```shell
espanso install prompts-dev --git git@github.com:alexsoyes/prompts-dev.git --external
```

### Updates

In order to have the updates, just:

```shell
espanso package update prompts-dev
espanso package update all # or if you want to update all your packages at once :)
```

### Usage

In combination with ChatGPT (or another generative AI).

Use this timeline to find and fix bugs.

* Either by using a keyboard shortcut (like `:cd...`)
* Or by using the dialog box (`‚å• + SPACE` or `ALT + SPACE`)

#### Quick demo

It saved hours.

## Contribution

* Community prompt list, so create a PR with your needs ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Report prompting issues / improvements at [hello@alexsoyes.com](mailto:hello@alexsoyes.com)

## Prompts list

I tried to respect the following convention.

* `:{group}` : Either code related or prompt related.
* `{optionalLanguageShort}` : Like `ts` for TypeScript related things.
* `{type}` : What we are talking about.
* `{action}` : A verb, a wish or an actions suite.

### Global prompts

#### Prompt evaluation `:gprompteval`

In order to improve and reduce prompt's size and improve efficiency.

```text
This is the prompt I made (surrounded with """) for an a generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT.

I need you to help me to make it better in order for the AI to better understand what I am asking about.

"""[[Prompt you have made]]"""

Please reformulate it to be clearer for the AI, do not hesitate to change complexe words with easy ones.
Merge duplication and remove not necessary instructions.
Be clear and specific.
Avoid ambiguity.
Use good english, fix text mistakes.

Please also acknowledge that AI can access URL, documents and generate images.
```

#### Answer evaluation with iteration `:ganswereval`

```text
Can you be self-critical of your answer?

1) Evaluate your own work. List its strengths and weaknesses.
2) Give it a mark between 0 and 20. Justify your score in terms of the rules you had to respect.
3) Make a list of suggestions that will enable you to achieve a score of 20, again in relation to these rules. Number each suggestion.
4) Rewrite your work following the recommendations in point 3).
5) Ask me if I'd like to repeat the process. We'll do this until your work is marked 20/20.

Thank you for you professionalism.
```

### Global dev prompts

Related to prompts chatting.

#### Who am I? `:prtsme`

```text

My project is about:

[[Fully detailed explanation]]

This only project I will refer to you within this conversation is only about this one.

I will try to always provide to you the relevant code associated to the feature or bug or whatever I talk you about.

The code will be surrounded by ", whenever possible.

Technically speaking, here are the libs we are using for our project:

"[[package.json or equivalent]]"
```

#### Acknowledge new feature `:prackfeat`

```text
Here is the feature that I want to code as a developer, can you acknowledge it?

Then, reformulate in bullet point grouped by section to show me that you understood what to do:

[[feature to build]]
```

#### Acknowledge new feature `:prdrivefeat`

```text
Please help me step by step to write the code for "[[step to do]]" with "[[tech]]".
```

#### Help to summarize a feature `:prsumfeat`

```text
I need your help about a feature I am trying to make.

Can you summarize the following specifications?

I need to clear my mind about it, I want to have some very clear statements about what the feature is about and its goal, the problem it is trying to solve.

Reduce irrelevant information from the specifications I gave you and reply as clear as possible to make it understandable by every one.

Use a bullet list grouped by sections (if necessary), you do not need that much details, just give the required information.

"[[feature to summarize]]"
```

```

#### Recode the feature `:prrecode`

```text
Your code does not work as excepted.

[[Explanation why it is failing]]

Can you auto-evaluate your own work?

1) Remind you the goal and try another way to code it.
2) Keep in mind that the code needs to be errorless and get the proper result I asked you about.
3) Can you remind me the goal, the entry parameters and the expect output?
4) Then provide the steps in order to fix the code you wrote.
5) Lastly, check for the generated code in order to be sure that it fits my needs.

Thank you for you professionalism.
