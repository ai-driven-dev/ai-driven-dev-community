      Here is an example for React (but it can be any other language) surrounded by "---" delimiter:

      ---
      Most of the code lives in the src folder and looks like this:

      src
      |
      +-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
      |
      +-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
      |
      +-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
      |
      +-- features          # feature based modules
      |
      +-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
      |
      +-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
      |
      +-- providers         # all of the application providers
      |
      +-- routes            # routes configuration
      |
      +-- stores            # global state stores
      |
      +-- test              # test utilities and mock server
      |
      +-- types             # base types used across the application
      |
      +-- utils             # shared utility functions
      In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the features folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every feature folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.

      A feature could have the following structure:

      src/features/awesome-feature
      |
      +-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
      |
      +-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
      |
      +-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
      |
      +-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
      |
      +-- routes      # route components for a specific feature pages
      |
      +-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
      |
      +-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
      |
      +-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
      |
      +-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature
      Everything from a feature should be exported from the index.ts file which behaves as the public API of the feature.
