      Dans ma formation Coder avec l'IA, j'ai créé un module "[[nom_du_module]]".

      Le but de ce module est d'apprendre aux développeurs à "[[objectif_du_module]]".

      J'aimerais faire le parallèle entre "avant l'IA" où les développeurs n'avaient pas d'autocomplétion précises ni de génération de code etc, et maintenant, "après ia", où l'IA nous aide énormément à coder plus vite et mieux.
      Le but est de montrer que pour les développeurs, nous sommes bien mieux à utiliser l'IA au quotidien pour développer.

      Sous forme de liste à puce, liste nos problèmes sans IA.
      Sous forme de liste à puce, liste les bénéfices / avantages de l'IA.

      I need you to help me to make it better in order for the AI to better understand what I am asking about.

      """[[prompt_you_have_made]]"""

      Please reformulate it to be clearer for the AI, do not hesitate to change complexe words with easy ones.
      Merge duplication and remove not necessary instructions.
      Be clear and specific.
      Avoid ambiguity.
      Use good english, fix text mistakes.

      Please also acknowledge that AI can access URL, documents and generate images.
