This repository is made to be easily updated by just editing the Readmes!

### Best practices

This is our best practices to use AI in your daily dev work:

1. **Use AI for repetitive tasks** - Yes, AI can be sometimes slower or mistaken, but in the long run, it will save you time.
2. **Adopt at least 2 AI in your daily work** - One for coding, one for instructions.
3. **Pin ChatGPT or equivalent in your browser** - Or just install the desktop app to always have it available.
4. **Enforce daily AI code generation** - Use snippets, prompts, and instructions to make it a habit, EVERY-DAY.
5. **Open AI Chat in your IDE** - Use a plugin to have it available in your IDE.
6. **Check all the prompts available** - Use them, change them, embrase them the more you can.

If you do follow these best practices, you will become a 10x Dev in no time.

![VSCode Setup](images/vscode-setup.png)

### Tools to install

- [Espanso](https://espanso.org) - Text expander to use the prompts in your daily work. (Required * for the prompts)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - AI to help you in your daily work. (Recommended)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) - AI to help you code faster. (Recommended)
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app) - OSX Clipboard manager to use the prompts easily. (Recommended)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Because Copilot AI features are available sooner in this IDE. (Recommended)

Free and Paid alternatives are available for each tool.

### Example workflow of an AI Driven Dev

Here is a basic workflow of how you can combine prompts, parameters and AI instructions.

![AIDD Workflow](images/aiddc-workflow.gif)

## **1#** ü§ñ Custom AI for developers

Custom instructions to transform an AI like ChatGPT into a RAG, now it became a member of your team that knows about the specs and the codebase.

### RAG Developer

Teach an AI to act as a Dev... from your own team

"Fine-tune" the LLM using a RAG to act as a developer in your project.

**This will help you to get the best out of the AI by providing it with the right context and knowledge about your project.**

1. **Documents list to provide** - Upload the relevant documents to instruct the AI about your project.
2. **Create a RAG for your project** - Instructions for AI to act as a developer **from your team**, using your language etc.

[Full page resource](./resources/llm-instructions/gpt-rag-developer.md) üîó

### Best Instructions

Personalize the AI to have better performance and quicker answers.

**This will help you to get the best out of the AI by providing it with the right context and knowledge about your project.**

[Full page resource](./resources/llm-instructions/chatgpt-custom-instructions.md) üîó

### Custom GPT Agents

Use those GPT agents to help you in your daily work.

(Include instructions sources)

- [Senior Dev](./resources/llm-instructions/gpt-senior-developer.md)
- [Agile Coach](./resources/llm-instructions/gpt-agile-coach.md)

## **2#** ‚≠êÔ∏è Developer prompts list

### Usage

This repo is filled of **amazing prompt for developers**, mapped with my favorite text expander, [Espanso](https://espanso.org).
Use the prompts in your daily work:

- Use a keyboard shortcut (like `:codeHelpMeThinking`)
- Or by using the dialog box (`‚å• + SPACE` or `ALT + SPACE`)

Basically, all prompts in the repository are available as an Espanso package.

**This make it easy for every developer to use the prompts in their daily work.**

### Installation

Guide:

1. Follow the [Espanso installation guide here](https://espanso.org/install/) for your operating system.

2. Then, install the package:

  ```sh
  espanso install ai-driven-dev-prompts --git git@github.com:alexsoyes/ai-driven-dev-community.git --external
  ```

3. Configure the package from [config directory](https://espanso.org/docs/configuration/basics/#structure):

From "`espanso path config`/default.yml":

  ```yml
  # prevent "v" being pasted instead of the prompt
  backend: "inject"
  # allow to keep current prompt in clipboard
  preserve_clipboard: false
  # reload when config / package changes
  auto_restart: true
  # delay to paste the prompt
  clipboard_threshold: 100
  ```

üîÑ **Note**: Update every time you want to get the latest prompts:

  ```sh
  espanso package update ai-driven-dev-prompts
  ```

### Prompts for developers (in IDE)

Here are the best prompts to use in your IDE... Sorted!

Enjoy your private prompts!

### VSCode snippets

We created a list of snippets we daily use as a frontend TypeScript developer.

![VSCode Snippet](images/vscode-snippet.gif)

AI makes way much easier code generation.

> But sometimes, when you exactly know what you need, you do not necessary need a Gen-AI to write obvious code for you.

Thus, AI can be mistaken, as a developer, you are the master of your code structure.

Feel free to use them!

**Languages**:

- [TypeScript](./resources/snippets/vscode/typescript.json)

**Libraries**:

- [React](./resources/snippets/vscode/typescriptreact.json)

**Installation**:

You can install them easily with the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# TODO: add OS support
# TODO: merge with existing files

PATH_SOURCE=$(pwd)/vscode
PATH_DESTINATION=~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/snippets

# Check if both source and destination exist
if [ ! -d "${PATH_SOURCE}" ]; then
  echo "Source directory does not exist: ${PATH_SOURCE}"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -d "${PATH_DESTINATION}" ]; then
  echo "Destination directory does not exist: ${PATH_DESTINATION}"
  exit 1
fi

# For each file in source, copy it in the destination, but if exists, rename it with a .bak extension and current date
for file in "${PATH_SOURCE}"/*; do
  filename=$(basename $file)
  if [ -f "${PATH_DESTINATION}/$filename" ]; then
    mv "${PATH_DESTINATION}/$filename" "${PATH_DESTINATION}/$filename.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)"
  fi

  cp -v "${PATH_SOURCE}/${filename}" "${PATH_DESTINATION}/${filename}"
done
