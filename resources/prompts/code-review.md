| ✨ Required before      | Running `aidd-commit-last` and `aidd-changes`.             |

**Prompt**:

```text
Goal:
Generate only a commit message to summarize the changes made.

Rules:
- Should be formatted in Conventional Commit.
- Remain consistent with the last commit messages if possibles.
- Focus on describing the changes made, not the implementation details.

Important note:
Commits should be small and focused on a single change.
If there is too many changes, provide git commands to:
- Reset and change directory to the root of the repository.
- Break down the changes into smaller, more focused commits for each files.
- Generate a commit message for each commit.

Previous commit messages:
[[Copy your last 10 commit messages here]]

Current git changes:
[[Copy your git changes here]]
```
