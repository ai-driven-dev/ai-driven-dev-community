**Prompt**:

```text
Your task is to analyze the provided code snippet and suggest improvements to optimize its performance.

Identify areas where the code can be made more efficient, faster, or less resource-intensive.

Provide specific suggestions for optimization, along with explanations of how these changes can enhance the code‚Äôs performance.

The optimized code should maintain the same functionality as the original code while demonstrating improved efficiency.

When providing your recommendations, consider factors such as algorithm complexity, data structures, and code organization.

Please wait for the user to provide the code snippet before proceeding with the audit, and ensure that your suggestions are clear and well-explained.

Rules:
- Reduce complexity.
- Improve readability.
- Enhance performance.
- Merge similar functions into one.
- Remove redundant code.

Steps:
1. Explain what the code is doing (in very concise bullet points).
2. List those points, then give detailed explanations of the impact and propose specific recommendations for optimizing the code (formatted as bullet points).
  - identified performances issues
  - identified readability issues
  - identified maintainability issues
3. Rewrite full code snippets with your improvements.
4. At the end of the audit, please ask me if I want to repeat the audit from step 2. with this time, the newly generated code, until you get a "no" or you reach a maximum of 3 iterations, or you are satisfied with the result.

**Prompt**:

````markdown
As a software architect, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive audit of a project structure. 

Brief:
You are required to review, criticize the project structure and identify potential issues that could impact the project's maintainability, scalability, and overall efficiency.

Goal:
Propose improvements to the project structure to enhance its quality and ensure that it aligns with best practices.
Feat every issue regarding the "Project" info and its tech stack.

Rules:
- Empty files or folders.
- Duplicate files.
- Large files.
- Overly nested folders.
- Overloaded folders.
- Inefficient project structure.
- Inconsistent naming conventions, generic names, or unclear file organisation.
- Files in the wrong directory.
- Use architecture best practices.
- Find inconsistencies and risks.
- Propose actions to improve existing architecture.

Tasks:
1. List rules to check in bullet points, then add more relevant ones regarding the project stack (suffix those by üÜï emoji to identify them) that can be detected using project structure and package manager file.
2. List every potential issue in the project structure.
3. For each issue, find all affected file or folder because the audit needs to be exhaustive.
4. Do not provide issue if there is no recommendation to solve it.
6. Only answer using "Tasks" and "Template" sections.

Template:
"""
# Architecture Audit

* Main technologies used in list.
* Description of the project.

## (emoji) Title of the issue

Very short explanation of the issue and why it is problematic.

* List of every affected files or folders.
  * ...
* Explanation of the issue.
* Short explanation of recommendations to solve the issue, provide tools or methods if necessary.
  * ...
* Example of how the issue can be fixed.
"""

Final steps at the end of the audit, ask the user to type:
1) Continue audit and ask user to specify more rules of your own.
2) Re-audit the project dismissing correct points.
3) Reupload new project structure and Re-audit.
4) Continue audit, AI will try to find new issues.
